Type script is super set of Javascript.
Transpiler makes typescript into Javascript. (Syntactic Sugar)

static typing:
let name : string
let name =""

interfaces
interface ICat{
	name : string
	age? : number (optional)
}

Angular CLI is a quick start that sets up the basic angualar system, tests, components and a variety of other bits and pieces

class
class cat{
	name:string
	constructor(name){			
		this.name = name
	}
}

Public\Private
class members are public by default
to make private - add private

Special case
class cat{
	contstructor (private name, private color)
	{
		//Creates locally iniatialsed private properties
	}
}



Ang1: MVC
Ang2: Component


{{user.name}} Interpolation  - double braces
[] Property Binding - square brackets and expression in quotes [src] = "user.name"
{{2 +2}} Interpolation  - NG would evaluate 
{{getIt()}} Interpolation  -Ng would call function

Expressions cannot use (=, +=, __, etc)
Cannot use new
Cannot use chaining
Cannot use global properies e.g. console.writeline.

Expressions Should be:
No side effects
Fast
Simple
Idempotent - always get same result

(click) = "doSomething"  - Event Binding
Statements
	allow assignements (only =)
	Simple
	Can Chain

Looping structure
<event-thumbnail *ngFor="let indexer of collection"  [property]="indexer"></event-thumbnail>
* means that they remove and add HTML to the DOM.
