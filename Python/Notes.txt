_ in the interpretter to get the last result.  Doesn't work in scripts

print is a a big change between Python 2 and 3

Colon indicates that a body will follow.

Don't mix spaces and tabs


import this - to get the Zen of python

import brings in librarys

help () allows documentation on library

use "from math import factorial" to cut down verbosity

or

from math import factorial as fac
to alias - however this may cause readability issues


/ floating point division
// integer division

python can scale integers automatically (and quickly).

len(str(fac(n))) converts to a count of the string length.

Integers : (almost) infinate size, decimal (or 0b for binary, 0o for Octal and 0X) and constructor int(3.5) for conversion
Rounding is always to zero
Int("") converts a int in a string to an int (optional base parameter)
Note in intepretter int("3", 2) doesn't seem to work (version??)

Float (15-16 decimal places)
3e8 = 3x10 power 8
float(2), float("2.5")
Also supports Nan - not a number
and "inf", "-inf" +- infinity
Int with float is always converted to float

None - no value.  None is sentence case

bool (True, False) bool(0)
Empty lists are considered false), empty strings are false
so bool ("False") returns True

if "eggs" 
is equivalent to
bool("eggs")

Nexting if statements, elif can removed the nexting

For Loops, While Loops (there is no Do While, Repeat until)
To exit a loop, use break.

input , gets user input

% modulus operator
